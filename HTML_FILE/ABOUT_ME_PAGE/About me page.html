                <b>There are a lot of stages that I have passed before being the last version of me.
                    The story begins...</b> <br><br>
            I was in elementary school. The first time modern educational methods began to appear. It was very amazing
            for me as a child to watch my lessons on <b>youtube</b> or interactive lessons on <b>Windows programs</b>, especially
            for <b>science</b> and <b>mathematics</b>. <br>
            I loved technology  very much and in the vacation, before the first grade of middle school, I knew that the
            computer and information technology curriculum would be added to the curriculum and I was happy and opened a
            video and discovered that the first lesson was about Scratch, and from here I knew what a programming
            language means.
            But I felt that scratch would not allow me to do a lot of things, so I searched the Internet, and do not
            remember what happened exactly. I learned C++ and python and my first resource was an application called AWS
            and I was very happy when I got the Python certificate and other certificates from the programming hero
            application and two certificates from the Grasshopper application. It was an achievement . <br>
            My problem was that I didn't know which field to enter, so I tried a lot. I liked the field of AI and ML,
            but my mathematical knowledge was little that I was learning specific mathematics (along with the school's
            curriculum), but it was difficult and I only understood some simple algorithms.
            I transferred and in the end, I settled on python and took machine learning videos and courses, because even
            if there are many programmers, only a few will work, those who are really well educated and who have the
            determination. <br>
            I decided to learn React and then React native, but I found Flutter more widespread and I started this year
            learning Flutter.
            My admission of my inexperience
            But so far I do not recognize myself as a programmer because the projects that I have done are very few and
            simple, and there is no one to help me learn or advise me to take algorithms and data structures courses.
            Therefore, there are some concepts that I don't understand. The only thing that I benefited from is praise I
            have a background in most fields and an understanding of basic concepts in programming languages. <br>
            My decision
            But this year will be a big transformation in my life, God willing, and I will learn most or all of the list
            that I wrote.
